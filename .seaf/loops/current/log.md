# Loop Log

## 2026-06-30 gather | initial context

Read the blueprint, confirmed the repo was an initial README-only project, and extracted loop concepts from the supplied Karpathy image: separated roles, negotiated contracts, disk-backed progress, trace logs, restartable loops, scored subjective criteria, and periodic harness deletion.

## 2026-06-30 verify | slice 1 spec review

Spec review found two gaps: lint/format checks were not encoded in CI, and the loop role named commits but not merges. Added Rust fmt/clippy, Prettier format checks, package lint scripts, and explicit commit/merge agent wording.

## 2026-06-30 verify | slice 1 quality review

Quality review found that `@seaf/sdk` advertised `dist/index.js` without a build path. Added package build scripts, CI build execution, a build tsconfig that emits `dist/index.js`, and a package file allowlist.

## 2026-06-30 act | slice 2 contracts

Started Rust-owned models and CLI validation. Scope is limited to deterministic file parsing, actionable validation errors, safe template init, a fail-closed eval placeholder, and release capsule structure checks.

## 2026-06-30 verify | slice 2 quality review

Quality review found four fail-open/package issues: crate templates referenced workspace examples, unknown fields were accepted despite schema closure, eval placeholder exited 0, and NaN effect sizes passed validation. Moved templates into `seaf-core`, denied unknown serde fields, made placeholder eval return nonzero, and required finite positive effect sizes.
